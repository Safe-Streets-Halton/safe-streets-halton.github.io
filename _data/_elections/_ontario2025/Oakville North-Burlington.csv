CALEB SMOLENAARS	Ontario NDP/NPD	Oakville North—Burlington		"Bike lanes are an essential part of sustainable, reliable, and accessible transit systems. However, right now, our streets are not safe. In areas of car-centric development like the suburbs of Oakville North–Burlington, road users like cyclists and pedestrians–myself included–are afraid when we head out each day.
We must improve mobility and safety in our cities by investing in safe, multi-use transportation infrastructure. The Conservatives' Bill 212 does not do this. Bill 212 takes us back in time with unscientific restrictions to future bike lane projects and the removal of some of the most well-used bike lanes in the province.
As a sustainable planning advocate and the Ontario NDP Candidate for Oakville North–Burlington, I stand firmly against all attacks on cycling infrastructure and I commit to enhancing safety for cyclists at home and across the province."	"I’m pleased to see the initiatives that the City of Burlington is taking to make transit more accessible. When I was in high school, I relied on bike lanes and public transit to get to school every day, rain or shine, so I understand the importance of accessible and reliable service. 
The Ontario NDP is committed to further diversifying our transportation systems to offer sustainable, reliable, and accessible mobility options for all Ontarians. This involves restoring 50% provincial funding for municipal transit operations, which will deliver improved service for riders. The Ontario NDP also commits to expanding and electrifying the GO bus and rail network to make Ontario’s regional transit system work for everyday people, including right here in Halton with improvements to the Lakeshore West rail line and bus service reliability."	"Vision Zero aims to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe injuries. What steps do you think could be taken in this riding to help achieve this goal? Are there any specific measures you would propose to improve road safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists - for example, at highway crossings?"
