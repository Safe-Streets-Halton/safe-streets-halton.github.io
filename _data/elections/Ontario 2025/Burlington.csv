You can read a little bit more in <a href=""https://brw.ontariondp.ca/news/harden-politics-plays-peoples-lives"">this statement</a>. Bike lanes are an important part of our transportation infrastructure and if I'm reading Bill 212 correctly, the government wants to make them less prevalent, more dangerous, and to allow the Minister to take action unilaterally instead of in partnership with municipalities and communities. This is moving completely backwards from what I understand is necessary to keep bike lanes safe, that you need clear and physical barriers to prevent injury and death. The Ford government refuses to admit that bike lanes are not the root cause of congestion and to recognize that bike lanes, along with fast and reliable public transit options, can alleviate congestion. Cyclists deserve to quickly take the quickest route to where they want to go and they should not fear for their safety when doing so. See also, the <a href=""https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/house-documents/parliament-43/session-1/2024-11-25/hansard""> comments from MPP Jessica Bell and MPP Jennifer French in this transcript</a>.","An Ontario NDP government would invest in more affordable and reliable results and ensure that public transit is faster. We'll do this by investing more into public transit operations, not just the initial capital. The NDP are committed to a 50:50 funding share of operations with municipalities and to GO rail improvements and transit expansions to make commuting across southwestern Ontario and Niagara more convenient, reliable, and affordable.<br/><br/>Specifically for Burlington, I know that many commuters choose to drive to our neighbouring cities because public transportation is a much longer alternative. For example, I work in Oakville and even though there is a bus stop near my house, it would take me about three times as long to transit to work, compared to driving. As part of our Homes Ontario plan, the NDP wants to increase housing density along major transit corridors. This would make transiting to work more feasible for those residents.I also think that we need to work with Hamilton to increase and improve the transit options between Burlington and Hamilton. The roads between these two cities are often majorly congested as a result of high commuter volume and poor transit options.","Road safety begins with roads designed to be safe. Road users will make mistakes, but these mistakes don't need to become tragedies. We can design our roads, highways and traffic systems in a way that minimizes the opportunities for serious injury or death, especially for vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. An Ontario NDP government would update the Ontario Traffic Manual to incorporate road and highway designs and best-practices that have been proven to minimize risks to pedestrians, cyclists and motorists."
