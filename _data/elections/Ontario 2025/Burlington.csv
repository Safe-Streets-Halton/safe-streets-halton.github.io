,y,"MEGAN BEAUCHEMIN","Ontario NDP/NPD","Burlington","https://meganbeauchemin.ontariondp.ca","In short, no, the NDP and I do not support the restrictions placed by Bill 212. You can read a little bit more in <a href=""https://brw.ontariondp.ca/news/harden-politics-plays-peoples-lives"">this statement</a>. Bike lanes are an important part of our transportation infrastructure and if I'm reading Bill 212 correctly, the government wants to make them less prevalent, more dangerous, and to allow the Minister to take action unilaterally instead of in partnership with municipalities and communities. This is moving completely backwards from what I understand is necessary to keep bike lanes safe, that you need clear and physical barriers to prevent injury and death. The Ford government refuses to admit that bike lanes are not the root cause of congestion and to recognize that bike lanes, along with fast and reliable public transit options, can alleviate congestion. Cyclists deserve to quickly take the quickest route to where they want to go and they should not fear for their safety when doing so. See also, the <a href=""https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/house-documents/parliament-43/session-1/2024-11-25/hansard""> comments from MPP Jessica Bell and MPP Jennifer French in this transcript</a>.","An Ontario NDP government would invest in more affordable and reliable results and ensure that public transit is faster. We'll do this by investing more into public transit operations, not just the initial capital. The NDP are committed to a 50:50 funding share of operations with municipalities and to GO rail improvements and transit expansions to make commuting across southwestern Ontario and Niagara more convenient, reliable, and affordable.<br/><br/>Specifically for Burlington, I know that many commuters choose to drive to our neighbouring cities because public transportation is a much longer alternative. For example, I work in Oakville and even though there is a bus stop near my house, it would take me about three times as long to transit to work, compared to driving. As part of our Homes Ontario plan, the NDP wants to increase housing density along major transit corridors. This would make transiting to work more feasible for those residents.I also think that we need to work with Hamilton to increase and improve the transit options between Burlington and Hamilton. The roads between these two cities are often majorly congested as a result of high commuter volume and poor transit options.","Road safety begins with roads designed to be safe. Road users will make mistakes, but these mistakes don't need to become tragedies. We can design our roads, highways and traffic systems in a way that minimizes the opportunities for serious injury or death, especially for vulnerable road users like pedestrians and cyclists. An Ontario NDP government would update the Ontario Traffic Manual to incorporate road and highway designs and best-practices that have been proven to minimize risks to pedestrians, cyclists and motorists."

The local community should have final say on where and how separated bike lanes are implemented. As a member of the City of Burlington's Integrated Transportation Advisory Committee(ITAC), I know the city spends much time and energy planning and engaging with the local community when considering transportation infrastructure changes.. I understand that after hearing from local engagement with the community through the committee, separated bike lanes serve not only cyclists in feeling safer when riding on the streets, but may provide a greater level of comfort to automobile drivers as well when cyclists share the road with them. ","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, when I was Chair of the Halton District School Board, I was advocating for free Burlington transit rides for all high school students. The mayor and the HDSB had worked out a basic memorandum of understanding for moving forward. Unfortunately, the pandemic paused the plans. I am happy to see that students do have some free riding time on Burlington Transit and that seniors can ride for free anytime. We have a long way to go. As I heard from the ITAC meetings, I know that good public transportation must be reliable, have good frequency, and goes where people want to go. Unfortunately, even though the City is earnest with its goal of a strong public transportation system, it does not have the funds to adequately implement it. I would advocate for further provincial and federal partnerships to help offset the development of a good municipal (or regional) transportation system. The pay-off in increased ridership is less in-town congestion, less carbon-footprint per traveller, and reduced road maintenance costs.","The mix of provincial, regional, and municipal roads has made for onerous planning and inconsistent implementation. These levels of government must come together to find common goals and create common or joint policies for the safety for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.  The riding of Burlington does contain or border the highway overpasses over the QEW. As someone who has lived their life north of the QEW, I know that the highway is a barrier for north/south travel when considering cycling or walking.  Since I am not a transportation or planning expert, I would look to experts to help find solutions for this problem. What I do know and will advocate for is ensuring we design our roads and these highway overpasses with cyclists in mind whether that is through grade separation, signaling, or other road design elements."
,y,"KYLE HUTTON","Green Party of Ontario GPO","Burlington","http://www.kylehutton.ca",Absolutely not! The Ontario Greens caucus opposed this silly bill borne from Doug Ford’s dislike of seeing bike lanes along his route from Etobicoke to Queen’s Park. As MPP I will support the repeal of the Bill 212’s restrictions and support municipalities seeking to expand and improve bike infrastructure and safety.,"As MPP I’ll be following our Ontario Greens platform on creating more affordable choices for transit, which includes investing and expanding on our GO train system (and interconnected municipal transit, bringing back a stable funding share from the province) and establishing an affordable intercity bus service.","I support the recommendations from Hamilton’s Vision Zero plan and would like to work with the City of Burlington and groups like Safe Streets Halton to implement them. This would tie in to creating a predictable annual infrastructure fund for building and maintaining pedestrian, biking, and other mobility options for municipalities to draw from. I would also like to see research into the effects of a general lowering of road speeds, following up on the success of the Welsh model which saw 2024 become their safest year on the roads, with collisions and deaths down across the board following the introduction of a 20 mp/h (32 km/h) default limit."
