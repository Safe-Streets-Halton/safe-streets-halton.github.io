The 2025 platform emphasizes creating diverse, thriving neighborhoods with a range of transportation options, including cycling infrastructure, to build better communities.  I strongly believe that decisions about cycling infrastructure should be made with community input, not imposed by the province. I will work with groups like SAFE STREETS HALTON to ensure cyclists’ voices are heard and fight to keep and expand bike lanes where they enhance safety and mobility.","The GPO is committed to enhancing public transit across Ontario. The 2025 platform prioritizes transit-oriented development and advocates for the expansion of public transit services. This includes increasing funding for municipal transit systems, promoting the electrification of transit fleets, and ensuring better connectivity between regions. We also propose uploading costs to the province that had previously been downloaded onto municipalities, including transit funding, to increase access for riders.  I recognize that strong public transit relies on community input. That’s why I commit to working closely with transit advocates, community groups, and local organizations to ensure transit planning reflects the needs of riders.","The GPO's 2025 platform supports this goal by emphasizing the need for building better communities with safe and accessible transportation options. My proposed measures will include implementing traffic calming strategies, enhancing pedestrian crossings, expanding protected bike lanes, and improving road safety for all users. I will also advocate for infrastructure investments that promote active transportation, such as cycling and walking, to create safer environments for pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.  Vision Zero requires collaboration between policymakers, municipalities, and community groups. I will partner with advocacy groups, local safety organizations, and residents to ensure that street design prioritizes human life and mobility equity.",,

,y,"CALEB SMOLENAARS","Ontario NDP/NPD","Oakville North—Burlington",,"Bike lanes are an essential part of sustainable, reliable, and accessible transit systems. However, right now, our streets are not safe. In areas of car-centric development like the suburbs of Oakville North–Burlington, road users like cyclists and pedestrians–myself included–are afraid when we head out each day.<br/><br/>We must improve mobility and safety in our cities by investing in safe, multi-use transportation infrastructure. The Conservatives' Bill 212 does not do this. Bill 212 takes us back in time with unscientific restrictions to future bike lane projects and the removal of some of the most well-used bike lanes in the province.<br/><br/>As a sustainable planning advocate and the Ontario NDP Candidate for Oakville North–Burlington, I stand firmly against all attacks on cycling infrastructure and I commit to enhancing safety for cyclists at home and across the province.","I’m pleased to see the initiatives that the City of Burlington is taking to make transit more accessible. When I was in high school, I relied on bike lanes and public transit to get to school every day, rain or shine, so I understand the importance of accessible and reliable service.<br/><br/> The Ontario NDP is committed to further diversifying our transportation systems to offer sustainable, reliable, and accessible mobility options for all Ontarians. This involves restoring 50% provincial funding for municipal transit operations, which will deliver improved service for riders. The Ontario NDP also commits to expanding and electrifying the GO bus and rail network to make Ontario’s regional transit system work for everyday people, including right here in Halton with improvements to the Lakeshore West rail line and bus service reliability.","I stand in strong support of initiatives to achieve Vision Zero and commit to championing road safety initiatives at Queen’s Park. This commitment is backed by the Ontario NDP’s plan to invest in public and accessible transit offerings that promote a shift away from a reliance on personal vehicle transportation. Additionally, an Ontario NDP government will update the Ontario Traffic Manual to incorporate modern road and highway designs that are research-proven to minimize risks to pedestrians, cyclists and motorists.",,
