# Key Points

* Despite going through one of the longest lockdowns in North America, Halton Region’s [traffic incidents in 2020](https://www.haltonpolice.ca/en/about-us/2020annualreport.aspx) totaled 6000, with 8 of those collisions having at least one fatality.

* Only 15% of Canadians are getting their recommended daily physical activity, with those in car-dependent neighbourhoods were found to be [70% more likely to be obese](https://www.ices.on.ca/Newsroom/News-Releases/2015/People-living-in-car-dependent-neighborhoods-more-likely-to-be-obese).

* Expanding and maintaining widened roads is expensive, and [can actually make traffic worse](https://archive.curbed.com/2020/3/6/21166655/highway-traffic-congestion-induced-demand)

* It is possible; [Denmark](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2013/02/20/the-origins-of-hollands-stop-murdering-children-street-safety-movement/) and the [Netherlands](https://globaldesigningcities.org/publication/global-street-design-guide/streets/pedestrian-priority-spaces/pedestrian-only-streets/pedestrian-streets-case-study-stroget-copenhagen/) were in our position before with higher traffic death rates

* The Netherlands is recognized by drivers as [“the best place to drive a car”](https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/best-place-in-the-world-to-be-a-driver-netherlands), largely because there are excellent alternatives to driving such as cycling and public transit.

* Three key actions to get us closer to Vision Zero and lower car dependency:

  * Improved road and intersection design

  * Improved standards for walking and cycling infrastructure

  * Zoning rules that allow for more homes and businesses within walkable neighbourhoods
