BURLINGTON - Safe Streets Halton, a transportation safety advocacy group, has released the following statement in response to the [proposed provincial law banning the construction of new bike lanes in favour of motor vehicles](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-government-bike-lanes-1.7328878):

"Considering any legislation to restrict active transportation across Ontario is an incredibly short-sighted move by the provincial government.

More cars on the road is not the solution to reducing traffic congestion. Bike lanes are a space-efficient and effective way to encourage sustainable commuting, and discouraging this will lead to more cyclist deaths and unsafe road conditions. Moreover, given the Halton Regionâ€™s rapid population increase, implementing this law will limit municipalities' response to growth-related infrastructure needs.

We need to see more, not less, ways for people to safely get around their cities to travel for work, to come home and to enjoy their daily lives. We encourage everyone to sign [cycleTO's petition](https://www.cycleto.ca/ilovebikelanes) or [email their MPP](https://www.ola.org/en/members/current#views-exposed-form-current-members-current-members-grid) to advocate for their right to a safe road environment."
