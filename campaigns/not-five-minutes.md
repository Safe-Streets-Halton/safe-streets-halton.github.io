# It's Not Just Five Minutes
Every year lives are altered or lost due to cars driving in the bike lane or other bike lane obstructions. 
* In Burlington, during construction on Plains Rd W, a man was riding to work, and due to misplaced construction pylons, sustained an injury that left his left arm with reduced mobility over a year later. 
* In May 2023, Doug Fritz was riding his bike to receive good news regarding a cancer screening, when he was struck and killed by a driver crossing into the bike lane. 
* In July 2024, a woman lost her life when a storage container was left in the bike lane on Bloor St in Toronto. The driver of an oncoming vehicle did not notice her change into the vehicle lane, and struck her. 

What might seem like "five minutes" can have grave consequences for those around you. The families of those involved in the incidents above have been forever changed. In these cases, "convenience" came before safety.
