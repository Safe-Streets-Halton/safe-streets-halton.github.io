<h1> Tell The Province You Want Safer Streets</h1>

        The provincial government has <a href="https://ottawa.citynews.ca/2024/10/21/reducing-gridlock-bill-ontario-bike-lanes-highway-construction/">put forward Bill 212 </a> 
        which will restrict active transportation across Ontario by limiting where and how cities can make safety improvements.<br/><br/>    
        <b>This will impact us all:</b> from families that want safer streets for cycling to school, to the people who want to ride a bike on a sunny day or to work. 
        Bike lanes are a space-efficient and effective way to encourage sustainable commuting, and discouraging this will lead to more deaths and unsafe road condit0ions. 
        Moreover, given Halton Region's rapid population increase, implementing this law will limit how we can respond to our growth-related infrastructure needs.<br/><br/>
        We need to see more, not less, ways for people to safely get around their cities to travel for work, to come home and to enjoy their daily lives.        
        </p>
